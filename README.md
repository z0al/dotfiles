My [NixOS][nixos] & macOS configuration as a [flake][flakes]. It features a shared [home-manager][hm] configuration between NixOS and macOS (aka. [nix-darwin][darwin]) hosts as well as host/platform specific configs.

## Highlights

**Shared üî•:**

- Editors: [Helix][helix] and [VS Code][vscode].
- Terminal: [Wezterm][wezterm]. The best terminal ever.
- Shell: [Fish][fish] üêüÔ∏è (inc. [starship][starship], [zoxide][z], [fzf][fzf] and [more](./home/cli/))
- Apps: 1Password (with git and ssh integration), Obsidian ..etc
- Other goodies: [catppuccin][cat]-themed editors/terminal, custom `nix*` CLI [wrapper](./bin/up)

**NixOS ‚ùÑ:**

- Desktop: Gnome + Pop Shell extension (+ more)
- Root (`/`) is mounted as a temporarily file system (`tmpfs`). Why? [Ok, hear me out](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/)

**macOS üçè:**

- [Yabai][yabai]: A tiling window manager.
